# Experiment Log

## Dataset
- CAMUS (non-commercial usage)

## Current best result (example)
- CNR: ~same or slightly improved
- ENL: improved
- Edge ratio: around 0.92~1.0

## Notes
- Too strong denoise -> blur edges
- Too strong detail reinjection -> speckle returns
- Best performance comes from balanced params
